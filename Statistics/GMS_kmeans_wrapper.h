			 RANDOM_INITIALIZE initializes the FORTRAN90 random number seed.
!
!  Discussion:
!
!    If you don't initialize the random number generator, its behavior
!    is not specified.  If you initialize it simply by:
!
!      call random_seed ( )
!
!    its behavior is not specified.  On the DEC ALPHA, if that's all you
!    do, the same random number sequence is returned.  In order to actually
!    try to scramble up the random number generator a bit, this routine
!    goes through the tedious process of getting the size of the random
!    number seed, making up values based on the current time, and setting
!    the random number seed.
